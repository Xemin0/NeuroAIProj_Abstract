# Characterizing Similarities in Task-trained Dynamical Models on Abastract Relation Tasks(*subject to change*)
TBD

### Requirements
```bash
python>=3.6?
#TBD
```
### Start As a Collaborator (`Terminal` / `console` in VScode)
- Clone the current repo to a designated folder on local machine in terminal by `git clone https://github.com/Xemin0/NeuroAIProj_Abstract.git`
- Create your own branch by `git checkout -b <your branch name>`
- **Work on your own branch**: whenever you want to upload your changed code to github type in terminal
```bash
# Track all files
git add -A 
# Take a snapshot of these files and add a comment
git commit -m 'update: <your comment on this upload here>'
# Push the changes to the remote repo
git push origin <your branch name>
```
- **Always submit a Pull Request if you want to combine your code to the main branch**

### TO-DOs(*subject to change*)
- ~Adapt the RNN to the Structure Predicting Task~
- Fix the Loss Calculation for masked output from RNN
- Fix the data generation and training logistics (currently no shuffling)
    - The target labels generation by input indices
- Analysis
